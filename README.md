# Mode of work - Are we in the future?

In March 2020, the world as we knew it changed forever. This change affected the way we work globally. Millions of people in the workforce were required to adapt to what was then described as a ‘new way of working’. Three years on, people have begun to settle into one of three broad work models; working from the office, their homes or a hybrid of the two. We are a group of students from Indian Institute of Management, Kozhikode, working on an academic submission to collect data and study individual preferences on the different models of work and what are some factors that influence those choices across various regions globally
